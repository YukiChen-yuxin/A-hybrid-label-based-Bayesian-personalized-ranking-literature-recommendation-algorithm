# A-hybrid-label-based-Bayesian-personalized-ranking-literature-recommendation-algorithm
This project focuses on the implicit feedback-based recommendation ranking problem, aiming to divide the full dataset into multiple local datasets by item label weights and user label weights, and to use a hybrid Bayesian personalized ranking recommendation algorithm in the local datasets

## Introduction
Compared with the traditional Bayesian personalised ranking recommendation algorithm, the hybrid Bayesian personalised ranking recommendation algorithm in this paper is complemented by adding a pairwise ranking triad constructed from the scoring ranking based on the independence weight coefficient algorithm, which constitutes a hybrid pairwise ranking triad. Finally, simulated recommendation experiments are trained on Python, and the final accuracy obtained by model evaluation is about 50% and coverage is about 90%.
